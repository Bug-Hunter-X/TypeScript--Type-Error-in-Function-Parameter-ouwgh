# TypeScript Type Error

This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript and its solution.  The `bug.ts` file contains code that throws an error due to a type mismatch. The `bugSolution.ts` file provides a corrected version.

## Description

A function expecting a string argument is called with an array, resulting in a type error. The solution modifies the function or input to handle the array correctly.  This is a frequent issue when dealing with function arguments and arrays in TypeScript.
